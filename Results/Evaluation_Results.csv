    *   Simple assault: Fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.
    *   Acts involving physical contact with the victim or intent to commit another felony: Fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 8 years, or both.
    *   Use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or inflicting bodily injury: Fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 20 years, or both (Voyage, Title 18, CHAPTER 7: ASSAULT).
*   **Assault on Process Server (18 U.S.C. § 1501):** Obstructing, resisting, or opposing any officer of the United States in serving or attempting to serve any legal writ, rule, order, process, or warrant can result in a fine under this title, imprisonment of no more than one year, or both (Voyage, TITLE 18, CHAPTER 73: OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE).

This applies to the federal offense for which they are sentenced or another federal or state offense if evidence of that offense was admitted during a federal sentencing hearing and exoneration would entitle the applicant to a reduced sentence or new sentencing hearing. For a state offense, the applicant must demonstrate no adequate remedy under state law exists for DNA testing and all state remedies have been exhausted (Voyage model, CHAPTER 228A—POST-CONVICTION DNA TESTING).

The specific evidence to be tested must be related to the investigation or prosecution of the asserted offense, not previously subjected to DNA testing (or a new method is available), in the government's possession with an intact chain of custody, and the proposed testing must be reasonable and scientifically sound (Voyage model, CHAPTER 228A—POST-CONVICTION DNA TESTING). The applicant must present a defense theory not inconsistent with any affirmative defenses from trial, which the DNA testing would support, raising a reasonable probability of innocence, and the applicant must agree to provide a DNA sample for comparison. If convicted after a trial, the perpetrator's identity must have been an issue (Voyage model, CHAPTER 228A—POST-CONVICTION DNA TESTING).

Regarding the handling of results, the results of DNA testing are simultaneously disclosed to the court, the applicant, and the government (Voyage model, section (e)(1)(A)). If the DNA profile excludes the applicant as the source and meets FBI requirements, the court orders submission of the DNA profile to the National DNA Index System (NDIS) to search for matches (Voyage model, section (e)(1)(B)(i)). The government submits all test results related to the applicant's DNA to NDIS (Voyage model, section (e)(2)).

If the test results are inconclusive or show the applicant was the source, the DNA sample may be retained in NDIS (Voyage model, section (e)(3)(A)). If the results exclude the applicant and match another offense, the Attorney General notifies the appropriate agency and preserves the sample (Voyage model, section (e)(3)(B)). If there is no match to another offense, the Attorney General destroys the sample and ensures it is not retained in NDIS, unless there is other legal authority to retain it (Voyage model, section (e)(3)(C)).

Inconclusive results may lead to further testing or denial of relief. Inculpatory results (matching the applicant) result in the denial of relief, and the government may move for a determination of whether the applicant's innocence assertion was false, potentially leading to contempt charges, assessment of testing costs, denial of good conduct credit by the Bureau of Prisons, denial of parole by the US Parole Commission, and notification of state officials if the results relate to a state offense (Voyage model, section (f)). If the DNA results exclude the applicant, they may file a motion for a new trial or resentencing (Voyage model, section (g)(1)).

Here's a breakdown:

**1. Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act (18 U.S.C. § 43):**

*   Economic damage is a factor in determining penalties for damaging or interfering with the operations of an animal enterprise.
*   The penalties increase with the amount of economic damage, ranging from a fine and/or imprisonment of not more than 1 year (if the damage does not exceed $10,000) to a fine and/or imprisonment for not more than 20 years (if the damage exceeds $1,000,000) (18 U.S.C. § 43).
*   Restitution under 18 U.S.C. § 3663 or 3663A may include restitution for the reasonable cost of repeating any experimentation that was interrupted or invalidated as a result of the offense, for the loss of food production or farm income reasonably attributable to the offense, and for any other economic damage, including any losses or costs caused by economic disruption, resulting from the offense (18 U.S.C. § 43(c)).

**2. Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (18 U.S.C. § 1030):**

*   ""Loss"" is defined as any reasonable cost to any victim, including the cost of responding to an offense, conducting a damage assessment, and restoring the data, program, system, or information to its condition prior to the offense, and any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other consequential damages incurred because of interruption of service (18 U.S.C. § 1030(e)(11)).
*   A civil action for a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1030 may be brought only if the conduct involves one of the factors set forth in subclauses (I), (II), (III), (IV), or (V) of subsection (c)(4)(A)(i). Damages for a violation involving only conduct described in subsection (c)(4)(A)(i)(I) are limited to economic damages (18 U.S.C. § 1030(g)).

**3. Trade Secret Theft (18 U.S.C. § 1831 & 1832):**

*   For organizations committing economic espionage (18 U.S.C. § 1831) or theft of trade secrets (18 U.S.C. § 1832), the fine can be up to 3 times the value of the stolen trade secret, including expenses for research and design and other costs of reproducing the trade secret that the organization has thereby avoided (18 U.S.C. § 1831(b), 1832(b)).

**4. Criminal Infringement of Copyright (18 U.S.C. § 2319)**

*   Victims of criminal copyright infringement are permitted to submit a victim impact statement that identifies the victim of the offense and the extent and scope of the injury and loss suffered by the victim, including the estimated economic impact of the offense on that victim (18 U.S.C. § 2319(e)(1)).

**5. Restitution for Victim's Losses (18 U.S.C. § 2248)**

*   Includes any costs incurred by the victim for medical services, therapy or rehabilitation, necessary transportation, temporary housing, child care expenses, lost income, attorney's fees, and any other losses suffered by the victim as a proximate result of the offense (18 U.S.C. § 2248(b)(3)).

**Criminal Forfeiture:**

*   **Violation of Section 1962:** A person must violate section 1962 of Title 18, which prohibits certain activities related to racketeering and unlawful debt collection (Voyage, Chapter ""Sec. 982. Criminal forfeiture."", Gemini, Chapter ""§ 1963. Criminal penalties."").
*   **Property Subject to Forfeiture:** The person shall forfeit to the United States (Voyage, Chapter ""Sec. 982. Criminal forfeiture."", Gemini, Chapter ""§ 1963. Criminal penalties.""):

    *   Any interest the person has acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962. (Gemini, Chapter ""§ 1963. Criminal penalties."")
    *   Any interest in, security of, claim against, or property/contractual right affording influence over any enterprise the person established, operated, controlled, conducted, or participated in, in violation of section 1962. (Gemini, Chapter ""§ 1963. Criminal penalties."")
    *   Any property constituting or derived from proceeds the person obtained directly or indirectly from racketeering activity or unlawful debt collection in violation of section 1962. (Gemini, Chapter ""§ 1963. Criminal penalties."")
*   **Court Order:** The court, when imposing a sentence, must order the forfeiture of the property (Gemini, Chapter ""§ 1963. Criminal penalties."").
*   **Restraining Order:** Upon application of the United States, the court may enter a restraining order or injunction, require the execution of a satisfactory performance bond, or take any other action to preserve the availability of property described in subsection (a) for forfeiture under this section (Voyage, ""[["")

**Civil Forfeiture:**

*   **Civil Forfeiture of Real Property:** Real property that is the subject of a civil forfeiture action shall not be seized before entry of an order of forfeiture. The owners or occupants of the real property shall not be evicted from, or otherwise deprived of the use and enjoyment of, real property that is the subject of a pending forfeiture action (Gemini, Sections).
*   **Initiation of Action:** The Government shall initiate a civil forfeiture action against real property by filing a complaint for forfeiture, posting a notice of the complaint on the property; and serving notice on the property owner, along with a copy of the complaint (Gemini, Sections).
*   **Pre-Forfeiture Seizure:** Real property may be seized prior to the entry of an order of forfeiture if the Government notifies the court that it intends to seize the property before trial, and the court issues a notice of application for warrant, causes the notice to be served on the property owner and posted on the property, and conducts a hearing in which the property owner has a meaningful opportunity to be heard; or makes an ex parte determination that there is probable cause for the forfeiture and that there are exigent circumstances that permit the Government to seize the property without prior notice and an opportunity for the property owner to be heard (Gemini, Sections).
*   **Exigent Circumstances:** To establish exigent circumstances, the Government shall show that less restrictive measures such as a lis pendens, restraining order, or bond would not suffice to protect the Government’s interests in preventing the sale, destruction, or continued unlawful use of the real property (Gemini, Sections).
*   **Post-Seizure Hearing:** If the court authorizes a seizure of real property under subsection (d)(1)(B)(ii), it shall conduct a prompt post-seizure hearing during which the property owner shall have an opportunity to contest the basis for the seizure (Gemini, Sections).

1.  **Authorization for Interception:** Obtain authorization from the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General, Associate Attorney General, any Assistant Attorney General, any acting Assistant Attorney General, or any Deputy Assistant Attorney General or acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division or National Security Division specially designated by the Attorney General to apply to a Federal judge for an order authorizing or approving the interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications (Title 18, § 2516(1)).
2.  **Application for an Order:** Make a written application under oath to a judge of competent jurisdiction that includes specific information, such as the identity of the officers involved, a full statement of facts and circumstances justifying the belief that an order should be issued, a description of the offense, details about the facilities or place where the communication is to be intercepted, a description of the type of communication sought, and the identity of the person whose communications are to be intercepted (Title 18, § 2518(1)).
3.  **Judicial Determination:** The judge must determine, based on the facts submitted, that there is probable cause to believe that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a specified offense; that particular communications concerning that offense will be obtained through the interception; that normal investigative procedures have been tried and failed or reasonably appear unlikely to succeed or are too dangerous; and that the facilities or place where the communications are to be intercepted are being used in connection with the offense (Title 18, § 2518(3)).
4.  **Order Specifications:** Each order must specify the identity of the person whose communications are to be intercepted, the nature and location of the communication facilities or place, a description of the type of communication sought and the offense to which it relates, the identity of the authorized agency, and the authorized time period (Title 18, § 2518(4)).
5.  **Minimization:** Interceptions must be conducted to minimize the interception of communications not subject to interception and must terminate upon attainment of the authorized objective or after 30 days (Title 18, § 2518(5)).
6.  **Recording and Sealing:** Intercepted communications must be recorded, if possible, in a way that protects the recording from editing or alterations. Immediately after the expiration of the order, recordings must be made available to the issuing judge and sealed under their direction (Title 18, § 2518(8)(a)).
7.  **Notice:** Within a reasonable time, but no later than 90 days after the termination of the interception, the issuing or denying judge must serve an inventory to the persons named in the order or application (Title 18, § 2518(8)(d)).
8.  **Disclosure and Use:** Disclosure and use of intercepted communications are limited to the proper performance of official duties by investigative or law enforcement officers (Title 18, § 2517(1)(2)).
9.  **Suppression:** Provide a copy of the court order and accompanying application to each party not less than ten days before the trial, hearing, or proceeding in which the contents of any wire, oral, or electronic communication intercepted pursuant to this chapter or evidence derived therefrom will be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed (Title 18, § 2518(9)).
