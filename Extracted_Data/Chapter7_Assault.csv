As thus revised this provision conforms with the first punishment provision of section 111 of this title.

Female genital mutilation is a heinous practice that often inflicts excruciating pain on its victims and causes them to suffer grave physical and psychological harm.""(3) Congress has the power under article I, section 8 of the Constitution to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution treaties entered into by the United States.""(4) Congress also has the power under the Commerce Clause to prohibit female genital mutilation. An international market for the practice exists, and persons who perform female genital mutilation in other countries typically earn a living from doing so.""(5) Those who perform this conduct often rely on a connection to interstate or foreign commerce, such as interstate or foreign travel, the transmission or receipt of communications in interstate or foreign commerce, the use of instruments traded in interstate or foreign commerce, or payments of any kind in furtherance of this conduct.""(6) Amending the statute to specify a link to interstate or foreign commerce would confirm that Congress has the affirmative power to prohibit this conduct.""Sense of the CongressPub.

The commercial nature of female genital mutilation (hereinafter in this section referred to as 'FGM') is 'self-evident,' meaning that the 'absence of particularized findings' about the commercial nature of FGM in the predecessor statute did not 'call into question Congress's authority to legislate' (Gonzales v.
