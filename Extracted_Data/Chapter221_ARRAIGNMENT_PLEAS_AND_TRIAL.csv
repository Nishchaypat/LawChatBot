The concluding sentence ""When any person is indicted for any other capital offense, such copy of the indictment and list of the jurors and witnesses shall be delivered to him at least two entire days before the trial"" was omitted. The change made by the revisers, permitting an additional day's preparation for trial in homicide, kidnapping, rape, and other capital cases seemed not unreasonable.Words ""shall be delivered to him"", at end of section, were omitted as unnecessary.Rule 10 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires that the defendant in every case be given a copy of the indictment or information before he is called upon to plead. Thus there is no conflict between the rule and the revised section.Minor changes in phraseology were made.Editorial NotesAmendments2009-Pub.
