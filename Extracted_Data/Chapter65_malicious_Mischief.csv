(See reviser's note under section 1 of this title.)The smaller penalty for offenses involving $50 or less was extended to offenses involving $100 or less. The use of $50 as the dividing line between felonies and misdemeanors originated at a time when that sum was of much greater value than $100 is now.The word ""damage"" was substituted twice for the word ""value"", and the definition of ""value"" was omitted as inapplicable to this section.
