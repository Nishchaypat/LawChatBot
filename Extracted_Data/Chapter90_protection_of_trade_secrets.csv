and(bb) the person against whom seizure would be ordered-(AA) misappropriated the trade secret of the applicant by improper means; or(BB) conspired to use improper means to misappropriate the trade secret of the applicant;(V) the person against whom seizure would be ordered has actual possession of-(aa) the trade secret; and(bb) any property to be seized;(VI) the application describes with reasonable particularity the matter to be seized and, to the extent reasonable under the circumstances, identifies the location where the matter is to be seized;(VII) the person against whom seizure would be ordered, or persons acting in concert with such person, would destroy, move, hide, or otherwise make such matter inaccessible to the court, if the applicant were to proceed on notice to such person; and(VIII) the applicant has not publicized the requested seizure.(B) Elements of order.-If an order is issued under subparagraph (A), it shall-(i) set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law required for the order;(ii) provide for the narrowest seizure of property necessary to achieve the purpose of this paragraph and direct that the seizure be conducted in a manner that minimizes any interruption of the business operations of third parties and, to the extent possible, does not interrupt the legitimate business operations of the person accused of misappropriating the trade secret;(iii)(I) be accompanied by an order protecting the seized property from disclosure by prohibiting access by the applicant or the person against whom the order is directed, and prohibiting any copies, in whole or in part, of the seized property, to prevent undue damage to the party against whom the order has issued or others, until such parties have an opportunity to be heard in court; and(II) provide that if access is granted by the court to the applicant or the person against whom the order is directed, the access shall be consistent with subparagraph (D);(iv) provide guidance to the law enforcement officials executing the seizure that clearly delineates the scope of the authority of the officials, including-(I) the hours during which the seizure may be executed;

The special master appointed by the court shall agree to be bound by a non-disclosure agreement approved by the court.(E) Service of order.-The court shall order that service of a copy of the order under this paragraph, and the submissions of the applicant to obtain the order, shall be made by a Federal law enforcement officer who, upon making service, shall carry out the seizure under the order. The court may allow State or local law enforcement officials to participate, but may not permit the applicant or any agent of the applicant to participate in the seizure. At the request of law enforcement officials, the court may allow a technical expert who is unaffiliated with the applicant and who is bound by a court-approved non-disclosure agreement to participate in the seizure if the court determines that the participation of the expert will aid the efficient execution of and minimize the burden of the seizure.(F) Seizure hearing.-(i) Date.-A court that issues a seizure order shall hold a hearing on the date set by the court under subparagraph (B)(v).(ii) Burden of proof.-At a hearing held under this subparagraph, the party who obtained the order under subparagraph (A) shall have the burden to prove the facts supporting the findings of fact and conclusions of law necessary to support the order.
