As reenacted in the Revised Statutes, such sections were extended and broadened beyond such basic acts. The language at the beginning, ""being a citizen or resident of the United States"", was inserted from said section 425 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., as enacted originally. While the basic provisions of said sections 421 and 422 are thus broadened, their application as enacted in the 1909 Criminal Code is narrowed.Designation in said section 421 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., of offender as a ""pirate"" was omitted as unnecessary. The punishment provision of section 1582 of this title (incorporated by reference in said section 425) has been adopted as consistent with other slave-trade statutes rather than the life-imprisonment penalty contained in said sections 421 and 422 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed. However, the requirement in section 1582 of this title that one-half the fine be for the ""use of the person prosecuting the indictment to effect"" was omitted as meaningless.Mandatory-punishment provisions were rephrased in the alternative.Editorial NotesAmendments1994-Pub.
