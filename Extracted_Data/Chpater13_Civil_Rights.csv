There seems to be no reason for imposing such a penalty in the case of one individual crime, in view of the fact that other crimes do not carry such a severe consequence. The experience of the Department of Justice is that this unusual penalty has been an obstacle to successful prosecutions for violations of the act.Mandatory punishment provision was rephrased in the alternative.Minor changes in phraseology were made.Editorial NotesAmendments1996-Pub.
