Irrelevant provisions of such sections in title 16 are to be retained in that title.Because of the general nature of this consolidated section, no specific reference is made to rules and regulations issued by the Secretary of the Interior or any other personage, but only to rules and regulations ""promulgated by authority of law"".The punishment provided by the sections consolidated varied from a fine not exceeding $100 or imprisonment not exceeding 6 months, or both, in section 694a of title 16, U.S.C., 1940 ed., to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 1 year, or both, in sections 676, 685, and 688 of such title 16.

All such prohibited mammals, birds, fish (including mollusks and crustacea), amphibians, and reptiles, and the eggs or offspring therefrom, shall be promptly exported or destroyed at the expense of the importer or consignee.
