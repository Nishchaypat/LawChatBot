That provision superseded section 744d of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., which authorized creation of the prison industries working capital fund and the first sentence of section 744e of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., directing that certain funds should be credited to the consolidated prison industries working capital fund.The phrase ""or received from the sale of the products or by-products of such Industries, or for the services of Federal prisoners,"" was inserted to make the first paragraph of this section complete, and required the Federal Prison Industries to account for all moneys under its control.The words ""in the repair, alteration, erection and maintenance of industrial buildings and equipment"" and ""under rules and regulations promulgated by the Attorney General in paying compensation to inmates employed in any industry, or performing outstanding services in industrial operations"" were inserted in part to conform to administrative construction, and in part to provide greater flexibility in the operation of Prison Industries. Much friction was caused by the inability of Prison Industries to compensate inmates whose services in operating the utilities of the institution were most necessary but which were uncompensated while those prisoners who worked in the Industries received compensation. This inequitable situation is corrected by the revised section.The words ""in performing the duties imposed by this chapter"" were substituted for the words ""for the purposes enumerated in sections 744a–744h of this title,"" since the provisions with regard to prison industries now appear in this chapter. The general provisions as to use of the fund supersede the more specific provisions of section 744f of said title (enacted earlier).A reference to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act as appeared in the 1934 act was substituted for the reference to specific sections of title 5. The word ""law"" was substituted for the reference to sections in title 31 since translation of the reference in the 1934 act was not practicable.Remaining provisions of said section 744e of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., relating to authorization of appropriations, were omitted as unnecessary.Other changes in phraseology were made.1949 ActThis section [section 64] incorporates in section 4126 of title 18, U.S.C., provisions of act of May 11, 1948 (ch. 276, 62 Stat. 230), which was not incorporated in title 18 when the revision was enacted.
