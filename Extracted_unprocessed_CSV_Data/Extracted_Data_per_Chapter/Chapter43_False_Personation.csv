L. 103–322, title XXXIII, §330016(1)(H), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2147.)Historical and Revision NotesBased on subsection (a), paragraph (18) and subsection (d), of section 746, title 8, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality (Oct. 14, 1940, ch. 876, §346(a), par. (18), and (d), 54 Stat. 1165, 1167).Section consolidates said provisions of section 746, title 8, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Aliens and Nationality. The word ""willfully"" was substituted for ""knowingly"", ""$1,000"" for ""$5,000"", and ""three years"" for ""five years"", to harmonize with congressional intent evidenced by the other sections of this chapter.Minor changes were made in phraseology and unnecessary words were omitted.Editorial NotesAmendments1994-Pub.

The effect of this consolidation was to increase the punishment for revenue officers from $500 to $1,000 and from 2 years to 3 years, and to rephrase in the alternative the mandatory punishment provision.This section now applies the same punishment to all officers and agents of the United States found guilty of false personation.Words ""agency or"" were inserted to eliminate any possible ambiguity as to scope of section. (See definitive section 6 of this title.) Other words referring to ""authority of any corporation owned or controlled by the United States"" were omitted for the same reason. (See Pierce v. U.S., 1941, 62 S. Ct. 237, 314 U.S. 306, 86 L. Ed. 226.)The words ""with the intent to defraud the United States or any person"", contained in said section 76 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as meaningless in view of United States v. Lapowich, 63 S. Ct. 914.Changes were made in phraseology.Editorial NotesAmendments1994-Pub. L. 103–322 substituted ""fined under this title"" for ""fined not more than $1,000"".","Amendments1994-Pub.

(See definitive section 1 of this title.) Words ""and upon conviction thereof"" preceding ""shall be"" were omitted as surplusage since punishment cannot be imposed until conviction is secured.Maximum imprisonment provision was changed from 1 year to 3 years so as to be consistent with sections 911 and 912 of this title, the latter having also been changed to 3 years. There is no sound reason why a uniform punishment should not be prescribed for the offenses defined in these three sections.Changes were made in phraseology.Editorial NotesAmendments1994-Pub.
