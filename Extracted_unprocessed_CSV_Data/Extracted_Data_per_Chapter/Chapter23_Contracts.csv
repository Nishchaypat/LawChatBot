Nor shall the provisions of such sections apply to advances, loans, discounts, purchase or repurchase agreements, extensions, or renewals thereof, or acceptances, releases or substitutions of security therefor or other contracts or agreements made or entered into under the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the Federal Farm Loan Act, the Emergency Farm Mortgage Act of 1933, the Farm Credit Act of 1933, or the Home Owners Loan Act of 1933, the Farmers' Home Administration Act of 1946, the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, or to crop insurance agreements or contracts or agreements of a kind which the Secretary of Agriculture may enter into with farmers.Any exemption permitted by this section shall be made a matter of public record.(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 703; Pub. L. 87–353, §3(o), Oct. 4, 1961, 75 Stat. 774.)Historical and Revision NotesBased on section 1514(f) of title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Agriculture; sections 264w, 598, 1138d(e), 1441(e), 1467(d) of title 12, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Banks and Banking; section 616(e) of title 15, U.S.C., 1940 ed., Commerce and Trade; title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §206 (Mar. 4, 1909, ch. 321, §116, 35 Stat. 1109; Dec. 23, 1913, ch. 6, §22(j), as added June 19, 1934, ch. 653, §3, 48 Stat. 1107; Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, §16(e), 47 Stat. 12; July 22, 1932, ch. 522, §21, 47 Stat. 738; June 13, 1933, ch. 64, §8, 48 Stat. 135; June 16, 1933, ch. 98, §64, 48 Stat. 268, 269; Jan. 25, 1934, ch. 5, 48 Stat. 337; Jan. 31, 1934, ch. 7, §13, 48 Stat. 347; June 27, 1934, ch. 847, title V, §510, 58 Stat. 1264; May 28, 1935, ch. 150, §§20, 21, 49 Stat. 298; Aug. 23, 1935, ch. 614, §101, 49 Stat. 703; Aug. 26, 1937, ch. 821, 50 Stat. 838; Feb. 16, 1938, ch. 30, title V, §514, 52 Stat. 77).These sections were consolidated with such changes of phraseology as were necessary to effect consolidation. Said section 206 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was the principal source of this section, but the enumeration of the kinds of commitments exempted was drawn from the various sections of said title 12 set forth above. The reference to crop insurance agreements is drawn from section 1514(f) of Title 7, Agriculture.The applicability provisions of the sections here consolidated were unclear and of doubtful value. As revised the section preserves everything of value without change of substance.References to the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act and the Farmers' Home Administrative Act of 1946 were included in this revised section notwithstanding the omission (and consequent repeal) of former subsection (d) of section 52 of the said Bankhead-Jones Act (1937) (Title 7, U.S.C., 1940 ed., §1026) in the amendment of said section 52 of such Act by section 3 of the said Farmers' Home Administration Act of 1946 (August 14, 1946, ch. 964, 60 Stat. 1062). The essential nature of the transactions under the several acts would render inconsistent any attempt to include some and exclude others.Editorial NotesReferences in TextThe Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act, referred to in text, is act Jan. 22, 1932, ch. 8, 47 Stat. 5, which was classified to chapter 14 (§601 et seq.) of Title 15, Commerce and Trade, and has been eliminated from the Code.
