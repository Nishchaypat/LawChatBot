Johnson, 1944, 65 S. Ct. 249, 89 L. Ed. 236, which turned on the absence of a special venue provision in the Dentures Act, section 1821 of this revision. The revised section removes all doubt as to the venue of continuing offenses and makes unnecessary special venue provisions except in cases where Congress desires to restrict the prosecution of offenses to particular districts as in section 1073 of this revision.Editorial NotesReferences in TextSection 7203 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, referred to in subsec.

Other provisions of said section 548 are incorporated in sections 1151 and 1153 of this title.Minor changes were made in phraseology.1949 ActThis section [section 51] conforms section 3242 of title 18, U.S.C., with sections 1151 and 1153 of such title, thus eliminating inconsistency and ambiguity with respect to the definition of Indian country.Editorial NotesAmendments1976-Pub.
