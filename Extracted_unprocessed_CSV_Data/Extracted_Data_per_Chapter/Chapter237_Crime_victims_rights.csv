Before making a determination described in subsection (a)(3), the court shall make every effort to permit the fullest attendance possible by the victim and shall consider reasonable alternatives to the exclusion of the victim from the criminal proceeding. The reasons for any decision denying relief under this chapter shall be clearly stated on the record.(2) Habeas corpus proceedings.-(A) In general.-In a Federal habeas corpus proceeding arising out of a State conviction, the court shall ensure that a crime victim is afforded the rights described in paragraphs (3), (4), (7), and (8) of subsection (a).(B) Enforcement.-(i) In general.-These rights may be enforced by the crime victim or the crime victim's lawful representative in the manner described in paragraphs (1) and (3) of subsection (d).(ii) Multiple victims.-In a case involving multiple victims, subsection (d)(2) shall also apply.(C) Limitation.-This paragraph relates to the duties of a court in relation to the rights of a crime victim in Federal habeas corpus proceedings arising out of a State conviction, and does not give rise to any obligation or requirement applicable to personnel of any agency of the Executive Branch of the Federal Government.(D) Definition.-For purposes of this paragraph, the term ""crime victim"" means the person against whom the State offense is committed or, if that person is killed or incapacitated, that person's family member or other lawful representative.(c) Best Efforts To Accord Rights.-(1) Government.-Officers and employees of the Department of Justice and other departments and agencies of the United States engaged in the detection, investigation, or prosecution of crime shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights described in subsection (a).(2) Advice of attorney.-The prosecutor shall advise the crime victim that the crime victim can seek the advice of an attorney with respect to the rights described in subsection (a).(3) Notice.-Notice of release otherwise required pursuant to this chapter shall not be given if such notice may endanger the safety of any person.(d) Enforcement and Limitations.-(1) Rights.-The crime victim or the crime victim's lawful representative, and the attorney for the Government may assert the rights described in subsection (a). A person accused of the crime may not obtain any form of relief under this chapter.(2) Multiple crime victims.-In a case where the court finds that the number of crime victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the crime victims the rights described in subsection (a), the court shall fashion a reasonable procedure to give effect to this chapter that does not unduly complicate or prolong the proceedings.(3) Motion for relief and writ of mandamus.-The rights described in subsection (a) shall be asserted in the district court in which a defendant is being prosecuted for the crime or, if no prosecution is underway, in the district court in the district in which the crime occurred. The district court shall take up and decide any motion asserting a victim's right forthwith. If the district court denies the relief sought, the movant may petition the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus. The court of appeals may issue the writ on the order of a single judge pursuant to circuit rule or the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. The court of appeals shall take up and decide such application forthwith within 72 hours after the petition has been filed, unless the litigants, with the approval of the court, have stipulated to a different time period for consideration. In deciding such application, the court of appeals shall apply ordinary standards of appellate review.

If the court of appeals denies the relief sought, the reasons for the denial shall be clearly stated on the record in a written opinion.(4) Error.-In any appeal in a criminal case, the Government may assert as error the district court's denial of any crime victim's right in the proceeding to which the appeal relates.(5) Limitation on relief.-In no case shall a failure to afford a right under this chapter provide grounds for a new trial. A victim may make a motion to re-open a plea or sentence only if-(A) the victim has asserted the right to be heard before or during the proceeding at issue and such right was denied;(B) the victim petitions the court of appeals for a writ of mandamus within 14 days; and(C) in the case of a plea, the accused has not pled to the highest offense charged.This paragraph does not affect the victim's right to restitution as provided in title 18, United States Code.(6) No cause of action.-Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize a cause of action for damages or to create, to enlarge, or to imply any duty or obligation to any victim or other person for the breach of which the United States or any of its officers or employees could be held liable in damages.
