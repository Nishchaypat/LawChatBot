In the first paragraph, substitutes ""Secretary of the Army, the Secretary of the Navy, the Secretary of the Air Force, and any two or all of them"" for ""Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Navy, or both"", and substitutes ""Army, the Navy, or the Air Force,"" for ""Army or the Navy, or both,"", in view of the establishment in 1947 of the Department of the Air Force, headed by a Secretary.2.
