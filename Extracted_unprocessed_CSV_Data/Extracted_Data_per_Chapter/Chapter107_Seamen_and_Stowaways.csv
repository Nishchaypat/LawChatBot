There seemed no point, however, in preserving a differential in favor of the stowaway as against the aider and abettor of $500. The court can be trusted to exercise a wise discretion within the slightly larger limits provided by the revised section.The provision for punishment of aiders and abettors in section 470 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., was omitted as unnecessary since they are punishable as principals by section 2 of this title.Sections 471 and 474 of title 18, U.S.C., 1940 ed., were omitted as obviously unnecessary.Editorial NotesAmendments2006-Pub.
